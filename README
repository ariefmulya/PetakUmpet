PetakUmpet (version-2) is an advance php framework which designed for
robustness and simplicity.

Processing concept in PetakUmpet

Every new Request is handled by a Process object.

Process will match Request module and action parameter to find the target
application action to execute.

Application can process request and then display output through Template
object which will use Response to manage the contents.

If needed Application can use Response object directly to render output.

Template view files shall be ordinary php scripts. With application and response objects available for them. Special $T template object shall be available for access to Template helper functions.

Standard view will be rendered inside a layout. There is a standard layout but applications can set their own layouts by calling Template's setLayout() function.
