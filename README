3. cd into lib and clone or extract the source to PetakUmpet folder

   > php lib/PetakUmpet/bin/init-project APPNAME --reset

[Request Processing in PetakUmpet]

Every Request is handled by a Process object.

Process will match Request module and action parameter to find the target
application action to execute.

PetakUmpet implemented role-based access control that would verify if each
request has access to the responding page application.

Verified requests can proceed to run the selected Application.  Application
can process request and then display output through Template object which will
use Response to manage the contents.

If needed Application can use Response object directly to render output.

Template view files shall be ordinary php scripts. With application and
response objects available for them. Special $T variable in template is an
object that shall be available for access to Template class functions.

Standard view will be rendered inside a layout. There is a standard layout but
applications can set their own layouts by calling Template's setLayout()
function. If an ajax request is detected the response shall be given without
layout.
